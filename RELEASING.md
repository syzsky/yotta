# Releasing Yotta

Yotta 4.0 separates an engineering candidate from a public stable release. The current repository license is source-available, not OSI open source.

## Frozen Windows candidate

For a product version's first release candidate, inspect the code-owned inventory and create the two immutable compatibility
floors once:

```powershell
task versions:inventory
task versions:compatibility:freeze
task nodes:compatibility:freeze
```

The freeze tasks are create-only. If a snapshot already exists with different bytes they fail instead of rewriting released
history. Review and commit `contracts/releases/<version>/`, `contracts/node/releases/<version>/`, and
`contracts/catalog/releases/<version>/` with the code that establishes the release.

Release endpoints come from the public, versioned [.env.online.example](.env.online.example) profile. The GitHub release job
loads it before packaging. For a local release build, configure the same values in the process environment or `.env.local`;
`task release:verify-services` rejects missing or development settings. Registry and Hub must use the online HTTPS services.
The loopback OIDC callback is intentional: it receives the login result on the user's own computer, not a local market server.

Then, from a clean worktree, run:

```powershell
task package
```

This requires both compatibility floors for the current `VERSION`, checks every older floor against the current readers and
Catalog, runs the canonical gate, builds the desktop executable plus CLI and isolated workers once, creates the allowlisted
staging tree and deterministic portable archive, then verifies hashes and smoke-tests copies of those exact staged binaries.
The frozen EXE's embedded service settings are also checked against the online profile, independently of runtime environment
overrides. No build occurs after staging or smoke.

The resulting `artifacts/Yotta-<version>-windows-amd64.zip` is an unsigned engineering candidate. `artifact-manifest.json` records the source commit, pinned toolchains, exact file set, sizes, hashes, origins and signing state.

## Automated GitHub release

`.github/workflows/release.yml` keeps two explicit paths:

- `workflow_dispatch` builds, attests and stores the frozen candidate as a 14-day Actions artifact, but never creates a
  GitHub Release;
- pushing exactly `v<VERSION>` runs the same frozen build and publishes the ZIP, SPDX/CycloneDX SBOMs and `SHA256SUMS`
  as a GitHub Release. An alpha suffix is already part of `VERSION`; alpha tags become prereleases, while a stable version becomes Latest.

The workflow rejects a tag that does not equal `v` plus `VERSION`, whose commit is not on `main`, or whose GitHub Release
already exists. It never replaces published assets. For example:

```powershell
$version = (Get-Content VERSION -Raw).Trim()
git tag -a "v$version" -m "Yotta $version"
git push origin "v$version"
```

The automated path currently publishes the unsigned payload produced by `task package`; use a prerelease tag unless the
stable-release prerequisites below have been satisfied and publishing that exact stable tag is intentional.

## Signing the frozen payload

After configuring a real Authenticode certificate and timestamp service, run:

```powershell
task release:sign-and-stage
```

This command signs the already-built desktop, CLI and worker executables, restages them with `authenticode-signed` manifest state, and repeats the frozen-payload smoke. The signing task has no build dependency and fails if any expected binary is absent.

## Public stable prerequisites

Do not publish `v4.0.0` stable until all of the following are true outside the local build:

- the final version-domain, NodeRef, TypeRef and CapabilityRef snapshots exist for `VERSION`; any retained pre-4.0 reader is
  explicitly classified as a one-time development migration rather than a public support promise;
- the rights holder has made and applied the intended license decision; the current license must never be described as OSI open source;
- canonical repository, module, update and security identities agree;
- main/tag rulesets, protected release environment, non-self approval and at least two real maintainers are configured and exercised;
- Authenticode certificate/timestamp, checksum, SBOM and provenance verification succeed on the final immutable assets;
- Windows installer/upgrade/uninstall smoke runs on a clean host; Linux/macOS remain preview until their native host smoke, signing and permission UX are complete.

The GitHub release workflow produces a provenance-attested unsigned payload. Pushing the exact `v<VERSION>` tag is the
owner-controlled stable release authorization; do not push that tag until the prerequisites above are satisfied. A manual
workflow dispatch remains candidate-only and never publishes a Release.
